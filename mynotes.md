##Davi-Tony Meeting Notes

Python dictionary data structure:
* example: a = ['first': 'Tony', 'last': 'Kukavica']
* command: a['first']
* output: 'Tony'

###**For 02/27 Meeting:**
>1. Complete Markdown tutorial

>2. Begin working on own tutorial about learning Github that will make sense to like-minded people

>3. Look at "Biowonks Github"

>4. Figure out how to get multiple line breaks in Markdown


###**Notes 02/27**
Writing & running tests

-All test files must be formatted: [filename/name of constructor class].tests.js
-Command to run: `npm test` (need to be in correct directory)
-Use single quotes, no double quotes, even then double quotes will work to begin with

Advantages:
-Simultaneously test while developing code
-Code is precisely tailored to perform desired functions

Disadvantages:
-Slower, sometimes less efficient than writing and debugging
-Frequently changing structure
